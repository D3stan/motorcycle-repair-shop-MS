# Motorcycle Repair Shop
Management system for dummy motorcycle repair shop as project for the Data Modeling and Databases course.

## Main focus
The main focus revolves around the [Entity-Relation scheme](ER-Scheme.lun) developed using [DBMain](https://www.db-main.eu/) software.  
The scheme was then simplified to match a _mysql_ DBMS structure.
After that, a WebApp demo was created to let the final user have a working UI to interact with the database.  
This WebApp is based on [Laravel-React](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/starter-kits#react) starter kit and takes advantage of its ORM to interact with the database.  
It also features an MVC architecture.
